# scripts

Small helpers for flashing and debugging OpenVent.

## `openvent`

Flashing and backup wrapper around `esptool`. See `openvent help`.

```sh
scripts/openvent backup                    # dump the whole flash to a .bin
scripts/openvent restore my-backup.bin     # flash a backup back
scripts/openvent install -t v0.2.3         # download + flash a release
scripts/openvent install                   # (no -t) → latest release
```

## `openvent-diag` — capture motor diagnostic logs

Use this if the vent motors are misbehaving (running too long, not stopping at
an endpoint, moving the wrong direction, etc.). It streams the ESP32's serial
log, saves everything to a timestamped file, and prints the motor lines in
real time so you can watch what's happening.

Requires `pyserial`:

```sh
python3 -m pip install --user pyserial
```

Then, with the device on USB:

```sh
scripts/openvent-diag           # auto-detects the port
scripts/openvent-diag -p /dev/tty.usbserial-0001   # or specify one
```

**What to do while it's running:**

1. Load the portal (`http://OpenVent.local/` or the AP IP).
2. Go to the Home tab and click **Open vent**. Wait at least 5 seconds even
   if the motor doesn't stop — the retry loop is what we want to see.
3. Click **Close vent** and wait for it to close.
4. Repeat a few times if you like.
5. `Ctrl-C` to finish.

The script prints a summary of the raw ADC values seen at each endpoint, and
writes the full serial log to `openvent-log-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.txt` in the
current directory. Share that file back to the maintainer (attach to an issue
or Discord message) so we can pick hall-sensor thresholds that actually match
your board.
